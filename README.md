# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aditya

### âœ¨ About Me
On my github, you will find projects of mostly web development, but also some game development, blockchain and also machine learning.

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I have experience with technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, MongoDB, SQL, Git, GitHub and API Development. My experience spans both front-end and back-end development, enabling me to create full-stack applications.

Additionally, I have experience in game development using C# within the Unity engine, where I've worked on creating engaging and interactive gaming experiences. I also have a foundational understanding of blockchain development, specifically in building decentralized applications on the ICP blockchain using Motoko. My skill set extends to basic machine learning, where I have proficiency in using libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and TensorFlow to analyze data and develop machine learning models.
